# Chess Trainer Application

This is my Fastify-Based NodeJS API template, an attempt to create organized, type-safe, and well-documented APIs using Fastify.
The architecture aims to seamlessly integrate features like dependency injection, auto-generated documentation, auto-generated [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) client, and comprehensive logging.
